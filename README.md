# Kisaan-Bandhu
Our project Kisaan Bandhu aims to revolutionize the agricultural market by providing end-to-end user support to farmers. We're creating a comprehensive website that guides farmers from the initial decision-making phase, helping them choose the right crops to grow considering factors like soil composition, weather forecasts, and market trends.
